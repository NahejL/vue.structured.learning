# vue.structured.learning
Attempt to structure knowledge in a model, in a website, built with vue; cause why not

## Idea
What if we defined a structure to communicate definitions and rewrote a dictionary with it?
Naturaly a single structure doesn't fit every types of mind, but it would be easily reusable and convertable to formats more personalized ... 

## Assumptions
It is assumed that whoever uses this understands logic.

## Definitions
Information: data; a single value
Sence: data source; the cause in a chain of effects; it is the information that triggers our minds in thinking
